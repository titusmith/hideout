    <div class="info-content">
      <p>The Hideout® is a one-man wrecking crew that occasionally works for money. Located in the Vinland valley outside Lawrence, Kansas (Rock Chalk), it's often referred to as the Midwest's most okayest-kept secret.</p>
      <p>Founder and author of this silly bio, Titus Smith, is a failed radio personality, terrible booking agent and burnt-out youth minister. He cut his teeth at ESPN and they all fell out when he got into advertising. Now, he spends his time running The Hideout® and teaching design at KU.</p>
      <p>Illustration, brand design, web design and copywriting — we do it all.</p>
